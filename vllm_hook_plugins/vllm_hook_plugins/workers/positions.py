"""Per-forward-pass request view: the single position authority.

Every consumer of positions — intervention scopes, gates, capture —
reads ``RequestPassView``; nothing else derives positions independently.
Built from ``ForwardContext.attn_metadata`` (``get_query_metadata`` in
``_common`` handles the hybrid-model dict walk) plus
``input_batch.num_computed_tokens_cpu`` / ``num_prompt_tokens``, and
cached by ``id(attn_metadata)`` — one build per forward step.

The row-to-request mapping is read from vLLM's legacy GPU model runner
(``model_runner.input_batch`` and ``model_runner.requests``). The V2
runner, vLLM's default for common architectures since 0.28, exposes
neither; ``require_runner_surface`` checks for the legacy surface once at
hook-install time and ``build_pass_views`` raises rather than returning an
empty view list when it is missing, so a mapping failure can never turn
every hook into a silent identity.
